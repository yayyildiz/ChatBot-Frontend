Chatbot Project

Overview :
This project is a React-based chatbot application designed to provide users with data insights through an intuitive conversational interface. The application allows users to log in with their credentials, retrieve their passwords via a "Forgot Password" feature, and interact with a chatbot powered by a backend AI service.

The AI processes user queries about viewing data, such as total views or series-specific insights, and returns results in real time. The frontend dynamically formats this data into easy-to-read tables, offering users a seamless experience when analyzing their data. This project aims to combine user authentication and data visualization in one cohesive platform.
